"""Upload one finished year part, with credentials that cannot have expired.

    python3 tools/upload_part.py --data-dir staging/publish <part.parquet>

s2_build.py --on-part-done runs this with each part's path the moment the
part passes its gpio check, so a build-year job that times out has already
published everything it finished. The job can run six hours; the OIDC
session configure-aws-credentials assumed before the build lasts one hour
unless the role allows more, and the role's MaxSessionDuration is not ours
to read (iam:GetRole is denied to every identity this repo holds; checked
2026-09-18). publish-backfill.yml asks for a six-hour session and falls
back to the default when the role refuses -- but this script does not
depend on which it got.

Before each upload it mints its own session: the runner's OIDC token
(ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL / _TOKEN, present in every step of a job with
`id-token: write`) exchanged for a fresh one-hour session through STS
AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity -- the same exchange configure-aws-credentials
does -- and exported to the environment of the upload_data.py child, and
nowhere else. The role comes from S2_UPLOAD_ROLE_ARN. When the exchange
fails the upload still runs on whatever credentials the environment holds
(the long session, if the role granted one); when there is no OIDC
environment at all (a local run) it runs on the environment or the
catalog.publish.yaml profile, exactly as upload_data.py alone would.

Every failure exits non-zero, and s2_build.py stops the year on that: a
part whose upload did not happen must not be counted as published.

The scripts that fetch, build, describe and publish the catalog. None of
them is published; `catalog/` is. The root [README](../README.md) lists
what each tool does and the workflow that runs it; this file covers what
the root README does not: how the two collections are kept in sync with
Earth Search, and how each was backfilled.

The fetch, repair, audit, build, stats and metadata tools take
`--collection` (`sentinel-2-l2a`, the default, or `sentinel-2-c1-l2a`)
and read everything collection-specific from
[`s2_collections.py`](s2_collections.py): schema, tile column, bucket,
sort key, row-group size, live compression, the lookback field.

## Sync & backfill

Two techniques, one per collection. The first collection runs on GitHub
Actions end to end. Collection 1 is backfilled and folded on the Taylor
Geospatial RAILS cluster, and GitHub only appends its daily tail.

| | `sentinel-2-l2a` | `sentinel-2-c1-l2a` |
|---|---|---|
| Backfill | `backfill` then `publish-backfill` (GitHub) | `tools/rails/` on RAILS |
| Daily tail | `refresh-daily`: `live.parquet` per year, zstd 18 | `refresh-daily`'s `refresh-c1` job, on when the repository variable `C1_LIVE_ENABLED` is `true`: `live-MM.parquet` per year and month, zstd 3, lookback on `created` |
| Consolidation | `consolidate-month`, the third of each month | `fold_live.sbatch` on RAILS, by hand, every 1 to 2 months |
| Repair | `repair-slices` (bucket crawl) | `repair_month.sbatch` |
| Audit | `s2_audit.py` by hand | `audit_year.sbatch` |
| Metadata | regenerated and published by each workflow | regenerated on a laptop, committed, `publish-catalog` |

### GitHub technique (first collection; not used for Collection 1)

Four workflows, in the order they ran once and the order two of them keep
running.

**`backfill.yml`** (manual, `start`/`end` months). A matrix with one job
per month, `max-parallel: 2` to stay polite to Earth Search. Each job runs
`s2_fetch.py --start --end` for its month into `staging/chunks` and
uploads the day chunks as a workflow artifact `slice-YYYY-MM` with 30-day
retention. A month whose artifact exists is skipped, so a re-dispatch
sweeps only the months that failed. No credentials: artifacts are the
hand-off.

**`publish-backfill.yml`** (manual, `years`, `run_id`). Three stages.
`plan` lists every non-expired `slice-*` artifact and groups the ids by
year. `build-year` is one job per year, `max-parallel: 1`: it downloads
that year's slice artifacts only (a runner has 14 GB of disk), assumes the
Source Cooperative role, and runs `s2_build.py` with `--split zones` from
2019 (four parts for 2019-2020, eight from 2021), `--skip-existing-url` so
a part the bucket already holds is not rebuilt, and
`--on-part-done "python3 tools/upload_part.py"` so each part is uploaded
on a fresh one-hour session the moment it passes `gpio check`. A job that
hits the ceiling has published every part it finished, and the next
dispatch builds the rest. `finalize` regenerates every year item and the
collection from the published parts (`--remote-baseline`), runs the
gates, and publishes the metadata.

**`refresh-daily.yml`** (03:42 UTC). Fetches the last five days by
`datetime`, finds the years in the slice, and rebuilds one `live.parquet`
per year from the previous live plus the slice, minus every id the year's
archive parts hold (`--exclude-ids-from`), so live and archive never
overlap. It splices those years into the stats table, restamps the two
collections, validates, uploads and publishes, and commits nothing. Its
Collection 1 job does the same per (year, month): see "The Collection 1
lane" below.

**`consolidate-month.yml`** (the 3rd, 05:17 UTC). Folds each year's live
into its archive parts, one job per (year, part) because eight octants at
zstd 18 in one job is 8 to 12 hours. `finalize` checks every planned part
arrived, writes a zero-row live per folded year, restamps, uploads the
parts and then the lives (a reader must never see the empty live before
the new parts), and publishes.

**Its limits**, and why Collection 1 does not use it:

- 6 hours per job. One first-collection octant of ~1 million rows is 50
  to 95 minutes at zstd 18; a Collection 1 year is up to 5 million rows in
  one file.
- Runner disk. `publish-backfill` downloads one year's slices at a time
  because 135 slices do not fit the 14 GB it has for them, and a whole
  7-million-row year spilled past the runner's disk in gpio's sort; that
  is what the zone split exists for.
- Artifacts expire after 30 days, and a matrix of 136 months at two in
  parallel takes days.
- Runner evictions during long bucket crawls (11 of 11 `repair-slices`
  attempts on one month), so the repair writes one chunk per day.

**To run Collection 1 on it instead** (if RAILS goes away), the edits are:

1. `tools/s2_collections.py`: set `zone_split=True` in `_C1`. `s2_build`
   then writes years from 2019 as zone parts (`zone_parts_for`), the tile
   column already drives `zone_sql`, and `make_items.parts_for` discovers
   whichever candidates a year has, so the single-file years already
   published remain valid.
2. `backfill.yml`: add a `collection` input, pass it as
   `s2_fetch.py --collection`, and name the artifacts
   `slice-c1-YYYY-MM` so the two collections' slices never collide.
3. `publish-backfill.yml`: filter the artifacts by that prefix; pass
   `--collection sentinel-2-c1-l2a` to `s2_build.py`, `make_items.py` and
   `make_collection.py`; stage under `staging/publish/sentinel-2-c1-l2a`
   and probe `--skip-existing-url "$PUBLIC_BASE/sentinel-2-c1-l2a"`.
   `upload_part.py` needs no change.
4. `consolidate-month.yml`: run its plan for both collections
   (`consolidation_plans(..., config)` takes the config; the `BASE` env
   and the staging path become per collection), so the monthly fold
   replaces the RAILS fold.
5. `refresh-daily.yml`: drop the fold duty from the `refresh-c1` job's
   header; nothing else changes, its live build already excludes the
   archive's ids.

### RAILS technique (Collection 1)
<!-- vale Portolan-Mechanics.Headings = YES -->

The full instructions, the credentials setup and every script are in
[`tools/rails/README.md`](rails/README.md). The shape:

1. **Login**: `ssh rails` (ssh ControlMaster with Kerberos and Duo; one
   login per session, by a person).
2. **Deploy**: `rsync -av --delete tools/ rails:s2-catalog/tools/` and
   `rsync -av catalog.publish.yaml rails:s2-catalog/`; `mkdir -p ~/s2-catalog/logs`
   once.
3. **Environment**: `micromamba create -f tools/rails/environment.yml -p /u/cholmes/micromamba/envs/s2`
   once; `env.sh` puts it on the PATH.
4. **Credentials**: an IAM user `rails-sentinel-2-catalog` in the bucket's
   account, either with `tools/rails/iam-policy.json` attached or allowed
   to assume the Source Cooperative role (`role-trust-statement.json`);
   either way a `source-coop` profile in `~/.aws` on RAILS. Only the two
   upload jobs use it.
5. **Run order**, in sequence:
   1. Smoke: `SMOKE=1`, one month under `_smoke/`.
   2. 2017, end to end.
   3. 2018, with the layout experiment.
   4. The array fetch of every month, windowed on `datetime`. Note the
      date it starts.
   5. The catch-up, `catchup.sbatch --export=ALL,START=<that date>`. It
      runs one fetch on `created` from the array's start to today, folded
      to `$SLICES/created-START_END.parquet`, which every build reads. It
      picks up what was created after each month's task ran, which the
      array and the daily refresh both miss.
   6. Year builds, smallest first, through `build_ready_years.sh`, then
      the uploads. Rebuild a year built before the catch-up: `rm` its
      `items.parquet` and run `build_year` again.
   7. An audit per year. Repair and rebuild a short month.
   8. The metadata commit from a laptop: `make_items.py` and
      `make_collection.py` with
      `--collection sentinel-2-c1-l2a --remote-baseline`, the gates, the
      commit, then `publish-catalog`, which restamps every collection
      from the bucket before it uploads.
   9. Set the repository variable `C1_LIVE_ENABLED` to `true`, on the day
      the catch-up ended, so its window meets the refresh's five-day
      lookback.
   10. Dispatch `publish-stats`, whose Collection 1 entry runs only with
       that variable set, to seed `stats-c1`.
   11. Flip the explorer's default.
6. **Daily**: `refresh-daily`'s `refresh-c1` job, on while
   `C1_LIVE_ENABLED` is `true`, fetches the lookback by
   `created` (so a scene ESA reprocessed last week, whatever its
   acquisition date, is caught), appends to
   `year=YYYY/live-MM.parquet` -- one live file per month, `MM` the month
   the scene was acquired in -- at zstd 3 with the year file's ids
   excluded, splices the touched years into `stats-c1`, and restamps both
   collections. It never consolidates. A day of refresh rewrites and
   re-uploads only the months its lookback touched, in steady state one:
   one `live.parquet` a year grew by about 15,000 rows (24 MB) a day and
   went back up whole every morning, which is 700 MB a day after a month
   and 2 GB after three. The single `live.parquet` the collection
   published before the monthly parts stays in the bucket with zero rows
   (the catalog never deletes); the first run under the monthly scheme
   folds its rows into the right months and empties it, and later runs see
   zero rows there and do nothing. Set the variable only once every year
   it appends to is uploaded and `publish-stats` has seeded `stats-c1`
   (its splice reads the published table); the fold below has the same
   condition.

**The periodic duty.** Every one to two months, and at the end of each
year, a person runs the fold:

```bash
ssh rails 'cd ~/s2-catalog && sbatch tools/rails/fold_live.sbatch'
# YEARS unset: every year whose published live parts hold rows between
# them. The refresh looks back on `created`, so a live part can sit under
# any year ESA is reprocessing, not only the current one. To name the years:
ssh rails 'cd ~/s2-catalog && sbatch --export=ALL,YEARS=2022,2026 tools/rails/fold_live.sbatch'
```

It downloads each year's `items.parquet` and every live part of it that
holds rows (`live-01.parquet` to `live-12.parquet`, and the pre-monthly
`live.parquet` while that still holds any), rebuilds the year
(`s2_build --collection sentinel-2-c1-l2a`, dedupe by id keeping the
highest `s2:generation_time`, sort `(_tile, datetime)`, zstd 18), uploads
the new year file and then a zero-row replacement for each part it folded,
and prints the laptop commands: `make_items.py` and `make_collection.py` with
`--collection sentinel-2-c1-l2a --remote-baseline`, the gates, a commit,
and the `publish-catalog` workflow. That workflow restamps the first
collection's items and both stats collections from the bucket before it
uploads, so the publish keeps the daily restamp instead of putting the
committed copies over it. Start the fold after 04:00 UTC: one that
crosses the refresh's 03:42 UTC rewrite of a live part loses that day's
`created` slice from that part until the next lookback fetches it again.

**If the fold is skipped**, the months keep growing. A whole year of tail is
about 5 million rows at zstd 3 across up to twelve files, which is more files
and slower ones than the year file would be, although each day's refresh still
rewrites only the months it fetched. A query still returns the right answer throughout, because the year item
lists every part and the collection glob reads them all. The year file lags the truth by however long the fold is late,
with reprocessed scenes present twice across the files, carrying the newer
`s2:generation_time` in the live part, until the fold dedupes them. The fold
recovers all of it when it finally runs, and no other step changes.

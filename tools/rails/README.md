# RAILS lane: Collection 1 on the TGI Slurm cluster
<!-- vale Portolan-Mechanics.Headings = YES -->

The `sentinel-2-c1-l2a` collection (Earth Search's Sentinel-2 Collection 1,
30.4 million items) is fetched, built and uploaded from the TGI RAILS
cluster, not from GitHub runners. A year of Collection 1 is one file of up
to 5 million rows; a GitHub job has 6 hours and 14 GB of disk, a RAILS
node has 192 CPUs, 512 GB of memory and shared storage. This directory is
the whole lane: one Slurm script per step, one `env.sh` they all source,
and this README. The tools they run are the ones in `tools/`, with
`--collection sentinel-2-c1-l2a`. The wider picture, and the GitHub
technique this replaces for Collection 1, is in
[`tools/README.md`](../README.md), "Sync & backfill".

## The cluster

| Fact | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Slurm; account `bgtj-tgirails`, partition `cpu` | Both `#SBATCH` lines appear in every script. |
| Nodes: 192 CPUs, 512 GB | A year build requests a shared slice (`--cpus-per-task=64 --mem=300g`). `--exclusive` never schedules while the fetch array occupies every node. |
| `/tmp` is a 64 GB tmpfs | Too small for a year file or a year build's DuckDB spill; slices, builds and those spills live on `/u`. The month fold spills there on purpose (`fold_month.py`, `FOLD_TMP`): a spill on `/u` failed with "Could not read enough bytes from file", and a month fits. |
| `/u` is shared project space (925 TB) | `$SLICES=/u/cholmes/s2-c1/slices`, `$PUBLISH=/u/cholmes/s2-c1/publish`; a job on any node reads what another wrote. |
| The login node reaps long processes | Everything runs through `sbatch`. `build_ready_years.sh` is the one script that runs on the login node, for seconds. |
| Slurm copies a submitted script to a spool directory | A script finds `env.sh` through `$REPO` (`$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR`, or `~/s2-catalog`), never through `$BASH_SOURCE`. Submit from the checkout. |
| Outbound HTTPS and S3 | The fetch, the repair and the audit need no credentials. Uploads need the `source-coop` profile (below). |
| Login: ssh ControlMaster, Kerberos, Duo | `ssh rails` once per session; the controller cannot log in for you. |

## Setup

**Deploy the code.** The scripts import `tools/*.py` and `upload.py` reads
`catalog.publish.yaml`, so both go over. `logs/` must exist before the
first `sbatch`: Slurm does not create the directory of `--output`.

```bash
ssh rails 'mkdir -p ~/s2-catalog/logs'
rsync -av --delete tools/ rails:s2-catalog/tools/
rsync -av catalog.publish.yaml rails:s2-catalog/
```

**Create the environment** once. It lives on `/u`, so compute nodes reach
it without `module load`. pip prints a note about botocore's urllib3 pin
while it resolves; the environment works.

```bash
ssh rails
micromamba create -y -f ~/s2-catalog/tools/rails/environment.yml -p /u/cholmes/micromamba/envs/s2
/u/cholmes/micromamba/envs/s2/bin/gpio --version   # 1.5.0
```

`env.sh` puts that `bin/` first on `PATH` (`S2_ENV` overrides the
location), sets `TZ=UTC` and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2`, and defines
`$SLICES`, `$PUBLISH`, `$REPO`, `$COLLECTION`, `$PUBLIC_BASE` and the
`run` helper.

## Credentials

Only `upload_year.sbatch` and `fold_live.sbatch` write to the bucket. They
run as the AWS profile `source-coop`. The `[default]` profile in
`~/.aws/credentials` on RAILS is another account (417712557820) and gets
`AccessDenied` on the catalog prefix; leave it alone, the scripts name
their profile. Prefer option (b) below for creating `source-coop`, because
the role is the identity every GitHub workflow already writes with, and the
user's own keys then need no S3 permission at all.

**Both ways start with an IAM user** in the bucket's account
(939788573396). Create the user `rails-sentinel-2-catalog` with no console
access. Create one access key pair for it, then write the keys to
`/u/cholmes/.aws/credentials` (`~/.aws` on RAILS) with `chmod 600`. The
user keeps that name from the catalog's first published location. An IAM
user name is not a URL, so renaming it buys nothing and invalidates the
keys already on RAILS.

**(a) The user writes directly.** Attach
[`iam-policy.json`](iam-policy.json) to the user: `s3:ListBucket` on the
bucket with an `s3:prefix` condition of `tge-labs/s2-stac-geoparquet/*`,
and `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, `s3:AbortMultipartUpload`,
`s3:ListMultipartUploadParts` on the objects under that prefix. Nothing
else, and no delete: publishing never deletes.

```ini
# ~/.aws/credentials
[source-coop]
aws_access_key_id = AKIA...
aws_secret_access_key = ...

# ~/.aws/config
[profile source-coop]
region = us-west-2
```

**(b) The user assumes the Source Cooperative role.** The role is the one
Source Cooperative provisions for the `tge-labs` organization. Its ARN is
the repository variable `SOURCE_COOP_ROLE_ARN`, which every GitHub
workflow reads; `$ROLE` below stands for that value. Add the statement in
[`role-trust-statement.json`](role-trust-statement.json) to the trust
policy of `$ROLE` (IAM console, the role, "Trust relationships", "Edit
trust policy"; paste it as one more element of `Statement`). It names the
user's ARN explicitly, so the user needs no policy of its own: a
same-account principal named in a role's trust policy can assume it
without an identity-based `sts:AssumeRole` allow. (If STS still answers
`AccessDenied`, attach this inline policy to the user:
`{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Effect":"Allow","Action":"sts:AssumeRole","Resource":"$ROLE"}]}`.)
Then the profile chain:

```ini
# ~/.aws/credentials
[rails-user]
aws_access_key_id = AKIA...
aws_secret_access_key = ...

# ~/.aws/config
[profile rails-user]
region = us-west-2

[profile source-coop]
role_arn = <the SOURCE_COOP_ROLE_ARN value>
source_profile = rails-user
region = us-west-2
```

boto3 assumes the role for one hour and refreshes the session by itself
from `source_profile`, so an upload that runs longer than an hour does
not fail on an expired session.

**Test the profile** before the first upload (boto3 is in the
environment; the aws CLI is not). Under (a) the delete is denied, which
is correct: the policy has no delete, and the one marker object is
overwritten by the next test rather than accumulating.

```bash
source ~/s2-catalog/tools/rails/env.sh
python3 - <<'EOF'
import boto3, datetime
s = boto3.Session(profile_name="source-coop"); print(s.client("sts").get_caller_identity()["Arn"])
s3, b, k = s.client("s3"), "us-west-2.opendata.source.coop", "tge-labs/s2-stac-geoparquet/_work/write-test.txt"
s3.put_object(Bucket=b, Key=k, Body=datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc).isoformat().encode()); print("put ok:", s3.head_object(Bucket=b, Key=k)["ContentLength"], "bytes")
try: s3.delete_object(Bucket=b, Key=k); print("delete ok")
except s3.exceptions.ClientError as e: print("delete denied (expected under option a):", e.response["Error"]["Code"])
EOF
```

`_work/` is scratch under the catalog prefix that no catalog document
references; the marker is the only thing this lane ever puts there.

## The scripts

Every sbatch: `set -euo pipefail`, `source "$REPO/tools/rails/env.sh"`,
`--account=bgtj-tgirails --partition=cpu`, output in
`logs/<name>-<jobid>.out`, idempotent (a finished step is skipped on the
next run). Two switches, both environment variables passed with
`--export=ALL,...` or set in the shell for a laptop run:

- `DRY_RUN=1` prints each command, shell-quoted, and creates nothing. A
  laptop needs `REPO=$PWD`: `REPO=$PWD DRY_RUN=1 YEAR=2017 bash tools/rails/build_year.sbatch`.
- `SMOKE=1` keeps every path under `_smoke/` (`$SLICES/_smoke`,
  `$PUBLISH/_smoke`, the `_smoke/` key prefix and public URL) and
  processes one month, 2017-07, so the whole chain runs end to end in
  minutes without touching the catalog.

| Script | Submit | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `fetch_months.sbatch` | `sbatch --array=0-131%8 tools/rails/fetch_months.sbatch` | One month per array task from `months.txt` (`months.py`): `s2_fetch` day chunks into `$SLICES/YYYY-MM/api/`, then `fold_month.py` writes `$SLICES/YYYY-MM.parquet` (zstd 3). An empty month writes an empty sentinel file. 4 CPUs, 48 GB (the fold's DuckDB limit is 40 GB, `FOLD_MEMORY`), 12 h. |
| `catchup.sbatch` | `sbatch --export=ALL,START=2026-09-19 tools/rails/catchup.sbatch` | One `s2_fetch --field created` from `START` (the day the array fetch started) to `END` (default: today) into `$SLICES/created-START_END/api/`, folded to `$SLICES/created-START_END.parquet`. Closes the gap between the array fetch (on `datetime`) and the daily refresh (on `created`, five days back); see "Run order". Same node share as one fetch task, and it needs no AWS identity. |
| `repair_month.sbatch` | `sbatch --export=ALL,MONTH=2019-03 tools/rails/repair_month.sbatch` | `s2_repair` from the bucket into `$SLICES/YYYY-MM/repair/`, then re-folds the month from `api/` and `repair/` together. The year must be rebuilt afterwards (the job prints how). |
| `build_year.sbatch` | `sbatch --export=ALL,YEAR=2019 tools/rails/build_year.sbatch` | `s2_build --collection sentinel-2-c1-l2a` over the year's twelve slices, plus every `$SLICES/created-*.parquet` (the build keeps this year's rows and dedupes by id), into `$PUBLISH/sentinel-2-c1-l2a/year=YYYY/items.parquet`: sorted `(_tile, datetime)`, uniform 6,144-row groups, zstd 18, `gpio check all`. Refuses a year with a month not yet folded. 64 CPUs, 300 GB (`--memory 250 GB`), 8 h, and it needs no AWS identity. |
| `build_ready_years.sh` | `bash tools/rails/build_ready_years.sh` | Login node. Submits `build_year.sbatch` for every year whose months are all folded, that is not built and has no `s2c1-build-YYYY` job queued; smallest first. Run it again as the fetch progresses. |
| `upload_year.sbatch` | `sbatch --export=ALL,YEAR=2019 tools/rails/upload_year.sbatch` | `upload.py` puts the year file under the catalog prefix as `source-coop`; a HEAD first skips an object of the same size (`FORCE=1` to replace). Prints the laptop commands for the metadata. |
| `audit_year.sbatch` | `sbatch --export=ALL,YEAR=2019 tools/rails/audit_year.sbatch` | `s2_audit` of the built year files on `/u` against the source bucket's S3 Inventory; delta table in `$PUBLISH/audit/YYYY.csv`; exit 1 when a month is off by more than `TOLERANCE`. |
| `fold_live.sbatch` | `sbatch tools/rails/fold_live.sbatch` | The periodic duty. It merges each year's published `live.parquet` into its `items.parquet`, then uploads the year followed by an empty live, and prints the laptop commands. The printed commands regenerate each folded year's search sidecar (`items.idx.json`, `tools/make_search_sidecar.mjs`) and upload it, because the fold makes the published sidecar stale; the explorer falls back to the footer until the new one is uploaded. `YEARS` unset folds every year whose published live has rows (one HEAD and one footer read per year); `YEARS=2022,2026` names them. |
| `upload.py` | called by the two upload jobs | Profile-based upload with HEAD skip-existing; see its docstring for why `upload_data.py` cannot be used here. |
| `fold_month.py`, `months.py` | called by the scripts | The month fold and the month list. The fold pins DuckDB to `FOLD_MEMORY` (40 GB) and spills to node-local `FOLD_TMP` (`/tmp/s2c1-fold-<pid>`). With the defaults, 50 array tasks failed in the fold, hitting an OOM under the 8 GB cgroup and a spill on `/u` that could not be read back. |
| `experiments/` | later | Layout experiments after the backfill; see its README. |

Watch jobs with `squeue -u $USER`, read a log with `tail -f logs/s2c1-build-<jobid>.out`,
cancel with `scancel <jobid>`.

## Run order

1. **Smoke.** `SMOKE=1` through fetch, build, upload and audit; then
   check `https://data.source.coop/tge-labs/s2-stac-geoparquet/_smoke/sentinel-2-c1-l2a/year=2017/items.parquet`
   answers a HEAD. The smoke objects are not catalog data; delete them
   from a laptop with the `tge-labs` profile when done.
2. **2017** (24,664 items), the first real year: `fetch_months` for its
   twelve months, `build_year`, `upload_year`, then the metadata commit
   (step 7) and a look at the year in the explorer.
3. **2018** (1.3 million items): the same, plus the layout experiment the
   design asks for (footer size with and without `assets` statistics; gpio
   against DuckDB `COPY`), recorded in `docs/query-performance.md`.
4. **The array fetch** for every month: `months.py 2015-10 $(date +%Y-%m) > months.txt`,
   `sbatch --array=0-N%8` with N one less than the line count. Re-submit
   the same array to sweep stragglers; a folded month exits at once.
   Note the day the array started: the catch-up needs it.
5. **The catch-up**, once the array is done: `sbatch --export=ALL,START=<the
   array's start date> tools/rails/catchup.sbatch`. The array windows on
   `datetime`, so each month reflects what the API served on the day its task
   ran; the daily refresh (step 8) windows on `created` and looks back
   five days from the day the variable is set. Everything created in
   between (new acquisitions of the current month, old scenes ESA
   reprocessed) is in neither. The catch-up fetches that window on
   `created` into one `$SLICES/created-START_END.parquet`, and every
   build from then on reads it. A year built before the catch-up does
   not have those rows: `rm $PUBLISH/sentinel-2-c1-l2a/year=YYYY/items.parquet`
   and run `build_year` again (then `upload_year` with `FORCE=1` if it
   was already uploaded). The catch-up ends on `END` (default: today);
   set the variable that same day (step 8), so the two `created` windows
   meet. A later `END` is another catch-up job with a new slice name;
   the builds read both and the dedupe handles the overlap.
6. **Builds, largest last.** `build_ready_years.sh` whenever more months
   have folded; it orders the ready years by slice size. Then
   `upload_year` per built year.
7. **Audit** each uploaded year; `repair_month` any short month, rebuild
   and re-upload that year with `FORCE=1`.
8. **Metadata, from a laptop** (the repository is not on RAILS):
   `make_items.py --collection sentinel-2-c1-l2a --data-dir staging/publish/sentinel-2-c1-l2a --remote-baseline`
   with an empty `year=YYYY/` directory staged per published year, the
   same for `make_collection.py`, `CI_LIGHT=1 python3 tests/run_all.py`,
   commit, run `publish-catalog`. The workflow restamps every collection
   from the bucket before it uploads (the first collection's items and
   both stats collections are restamped daily and never committed), so
   a publish never puts the committed copies over the daily restamp.
   Then set the repository variable `C1_LIVE_ENABLED` to `true`
   (GitHub, Settings, Variables), on the day the catch-up ended.
9. **Stats**: with the variable set, dispatch `publish-stats`; its
   `sentinel-2-c1-l2a` entry (the `stats-c1` collection) runs only with
   the variable set. The same variable turns on the daily job, whose
   stats splice reads the table this dispatch seeds, so dispatch it the
   same day.
10. **Explorer**: flip the default collection when the backfill and the
    stats are complete.
11. **Folds** start only after step 6 has uploaded every year the daily
    refresh appends to (any year, because it looks back on `created`);
    see the next section.

## The periodic duty: fold live

The daily GitHub refresh (its `refresh-c1` job, on while the repository
variable `C1_LIVE_ENABLED` is `true`) appends Collection 1's new and
reprocessed items to
`year=YYYY/live.parquet` at zstd 3 and never consolidates. The refresh
looks back on `created`, and ESA is reprocessing old years, so a live
part can sit under any year, not only the current one. A year is folded
only after its backfill is uploaded: `fold_live` stops on a year that
has slices under `$SLICES` but no published `items.parquet`, so a
live-only year file can never take the place of an unbuilt year. Every
one to two months, and at the end of each year:

```bash
ssh rails 'cd ~/s2-catalog && sbatch tools/rails/fold_live.sbatch'
# YEARS unset: every year from 2015 to now whose published live.parquet
# holds rows (one HEAD and one footer read per year). To name them:
ssh rails 'cd ~/s2-catalog && sbatch --export=ALL,YEARS=2022,2026 tools/rails/fold_live.sbatch'
```

Start it after 04:00 UTC: the refresh rewrites live at 03:42 UTC, and a
fold that crosses that moment puts its empty live over the refresh's new
one. The loss is that day's `created` slice, which the next refresh's
five-day lookback fetches again, so it heals within a day.

Then, on a laptop, the metadata commands the job prints (`make_items` and
`make_collection` with `--remote-baseline`, the gates, a commit) and the
`publish-catalog` workflow, which restamps every collection from the
bucket before it uploads. The daily refresh needs no intervention, because
its next run finds the emptied live and starts a new tail, disjoint from the
year file.

If the fold is skipped, nothing breaks. `live.parquet` keeps growing at
zstd 3 (a whole year of Collection 1 in live is about 5 million rows in a
larger, less compressed file), every query returns the right answer because
the year item lists both files and the collection's glob reads both, and the
year file lags the truth by however long the fold is late. A reprocessed scene
is in live with a newer `s2:generation_time` next to the archive's copy
until the fold dedupes them.

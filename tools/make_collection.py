"""Generate catalog/<catalog_dir>/collection.json from the published data.

Row counts, the temporal extent and the partition file count are measured,
never hand-written: from each year's committed item where one exists, and from
the Parquet footers of anything staged that no item describes yet. Run this
after tools/make_items.py and before publishing. It is also what lets the
scheduled refresh restamp `updated`, the row count and the temporal extent
without a commit -- the generator runs, the publisher uploads, and the
repository keeps only the stable definition.

The items are the authority for a year, and that is deliberate. --data-dir
sees only what is staged on this machine, which for the daily refresh is one
rolling tail. Reporting that as the collection's extent would tell a client the
archive covers five days and holds a few hundred thousand rows. Each item
carries its whole year, read from the Parquet footer, so the collection is the
union of the items plus whatever is staged that has no item.

    python3 tools/make_collection.py --data-dir ./staging/publish/sentinel-2-l2a
    python3 tools/make_collection.py --data-dir ... --remote-baseline

--remote-baseline means the same thing it means in make_items.py: for a year
that is staged but has no committed item, parts missing from --data-dir are
read from the published copy over HTTP rather than assumed absent.

`table:columns` is generated from the collection's schema module
(tools/s2_schema.py, tools/s2c1_schema.py), which is the single source of
truth for the published schema. `item_assets` comes from the committed cache
for the collection (tools/item_assets.json, tools/item_assets_c1.json), never
the network; refresh it deliberately with --refresh-item-assets.

--collection picks the collection (s2_collections; default the first one, so
every existing call is unchanged). Everything that names the collection
follows the config: id and title, the description's layout and sort-order
sentences (derived from s2_build's rules for that collection, so the prose
cannot say one order when the builder writes another), the columns, the
item_assets cache, the partition glob, the canonical link and the default
--out (catalog/<catalog_dir>/collection.json):

    python3 tools/make_collection.py --collection sentinel-2-c1-l2a \\

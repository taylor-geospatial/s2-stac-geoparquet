# Monthly live parts for Collection 1 — what was done

Answers `docs/monthly-live-brief.md`. Branch `s2-monthly-live-work`, nine
commits over `main`, one per ruling where that was natural. The first two
(`--months` with the one list of live part names, and the `make_items` half
of the metadata ruling) were made before this report and are described here
for completeness.

Collection 1 only. Nothing under `catalog/sentinel-2-l2a/`, and no code path
of the first collection, changed: `live_part_names(DEFAULT_CONFIG)` is still
`("live",)`, so every list it drives is the list it was.

## The shape, as built

`sentinel-2-c1-l2a/year=YYYY/live-MM.parquet`, `MM` zero-padded, zstd 3,
sorted `(_tile, datetime)` like the archive. A year is still one
`items.parquet`. The one `live.parquet` the collection published before
the move stays in the bucket at zero rows, because this catalog never
deletes, and stays in every list that enumerates a year's parts.

Those names are spelled in exactly two functions in `tools/s2_build.py` (ruling 1, committed before this report): `live_month_name(m)` and
`live_part_names(config)`. Every workflow, the fold, the metadata generators
and the explorer take their list from there; a test refuses a literal
`live-MM.parquet` on any line of any workflow that runs.

## Ruling 2 — the refresh

`refresh-c1` in `.github/workflows/refresh-daily.yml`.

**Plan.** The step now takes `(year, month)` pairs from the slice
(`SELECT DISTINCT year(datetime), month(datetime)`, session zone UTC, the
build's own zone) instead of years alone, and writes per year:

| file | holds |
|---|---|
| `archive.urls` | the year's published archive parts (`archive_part_names`) |
| `months` | the months to build: the slice's, plus every month the pre-monthly `live.parquet` still holds |
| `migrate` | does `live.parquet` still hold rows? |
| `prev-MM` | one marker per published monthly part |
| `splice.urls` | the year's published monthly parts this run leaves alone |

Every probe is `s2_build.published_part` (retried; anything but 200 or 404
stops the run), and the row count of `live.parquet` is one footer read
(`published_rows`).

**Build.** One `s2_build.py --years Y --months M --name live-MM.parquet
--zstd-level 3` per pair, sources being the slice, the published
`live-MM.parquet` when the plan saw one (its GET must then succeed), and the
pre-monthly `live.parquet` while it still holds rows. `--exclude-ids-from`
the year file, unchanged. The step fails if the build wrote no file for a
month the plan named, because the splice below would then be short a month.

**Splice.** `s2_stats.py --merge-years` replaces a year's whole table, so
the sources must be the year's whole row set: the year file, the monthly
parts this run built, and the year's other published monthly parts where
they are. Without that last list a year whose August part was not touched
today would lose August from `mgrs-monthly.parquet`. The pre-monthly
`live.parquet` is never a source, because it is empty, or because this run
has just moved its rows into the monthly parts.

**Upload.** Two passes, the idiom `consolidate-month.yml` already uses:
every part but `live.parquet` through `--only`, one at a time, then one pass
over the rest. See the migration below for why the order matters.

## Ruling 3 — migrating the published `year=2026/live.parquet`

The published file held **51,505 rows on 2026-09-26**, all acquired in
September 2026 (a fold ran recently, so the tail is one month today). The
migration is one month in practice, and written for any number.

**What the run does.** A year is a year to migrate when its `live.parquet`
answers 200 and its footer reports rows. The plan reads the months in
it (`SELECT DISTINCT month(datetime)` over HTTP, the `datetime` column only)
and adds them to the year's `months`. The build then has that file in the
source list of every month of the year, so each row is written to the month
it was acquired in, deduped on `id` against the slice and the published monthly
part. After the year's months are written, the step stages a **zero-row**
`live.parquet` over it (`s2_build.write_empty_part`, the schema of the
downloaded file, the same writer the fold and `consolidate-month` use).

**Why it is idempotent.** The trigger is the row count of the published
`live.parquet`, which the migration itself drives to zero:

* Run 1 sees rows and folds them into the months, then publishes the empty
  file.
* Run 2 reads zero rows in the same probe and stops there, downloading
  nothing and rewriting nothing. The file stays in the bucket, emptied, for
  the clients that still read the old name.
* A run that writes the months and then fails before the empty file is
  published leaves the rows in **both** places. Every row is still readable,
  and a glob counts those scenes twice until the next run, which the dedupe on `id`
  already removes for any reader that follows the documented recipe. The
  next run sees rows again and folds them again, which is a no-op on the
  monthly parts (same ids, same generation times).
* The merge is by `id` with the highest `s2:generation_time`, so folding the
  same rows twice cannot duplicate a scene inside a part.

**The upload order is the safe one.** The monthly parts go up first,
each through `--only`, and the emptied `live.parquet` only in the pass after
them. The dangerous order is the other one: an empty `live.parquet` on the
bucket while the months for its rows are still absent is a hole, and
those scenes are older than the five-day lookback, so nothing would fetch
them again. The order above can only ever produce the harmless state
(double-counted for minutes, or until tomorrow).

**What it is not.** No step deletes, renames or moves a published object,
and no step writes to the bucket outside the two upload passes. A dry run
was made against the real bucket with the upload stubbed (below).

## Ruling 4 — metadata

`make_items.py` (committed earlier on the branch) probes `items.parquet`
plus `live_part_names(config)`. It gives every month present its own asset with
its own row count and time range, and sums the year's totals over whatever
exists. `make_collection.py` follows with no new enumeration of its own: it
calls the same `discover()` for a staged year, so `partition:file_count`,
`table:row_count` and the temporal extent count the months that are there,
and its prose (`year_file_text`, `description`) names `live-01.parquet` to
`live-12.parquet`, says a day of refresh rewrites only the months it
fetched, and sends a reprocessed scene to the live part of the month it was
acquired in. The committed `collection.json` still carries the sentence its
last restamp wrote; the daily refresh restamps it from the bucket, as it
does every measured field.

**One bug found and fixed here, and it would have stopped the migration.**
A part with no rows has no `datetime` statistics to read, and `build_item`
wrote `"start_datetime": null, "end_datetime": null` into its asset. Null is
not a string: stac-check and rashid (PTL-STR-001) both reject the item, and
that gate runs in every workflow before it uploads. The run that empties the
pre-monthly `live.parquet` would have failed its own "Validate
before upload" step and uploaded nothing. Measured on the real 2026 item with
an emptied `live` asset added: 2 rashid errors with the nulls, 0 with the
pair left out. `make_items` now leaves it out, and a test in
`tests/test_make_items.py` builds an emptied part and refuses the null. The
same bug was reachable without this work -- any fold or consolidation, or a
day the year file already contained every staged row, empties a part the
same way.

## Ruling 5 — the app

`apps/explorer/app.js`:

* `windowMonths(year, d0, d1)` — the months of `year` the search window
  touches. A window inside one month gives one month; a window that starts
  before the year starts at January and one that ends after it ends at
  December; a year outside the window gives none. A December-to-January
  window asks December of the first year and January of the
  second, which a unit test pins in node over nine cases.
* Collection 1's `parts(year, tile, months)` is `["items", "live",
  ...months.map(live-MM)]`. A one-month window probes three names, never
  fourteen.
* `partUrlsFor(year, tile, d0 = TODAY, d1 = TODAY)` is the one place a part
  URL is built, so the search (`partUrls`) and the prefetch
  (`warmWindowParts`) cannot read different files. The callers that only ask
  whether a year is published pass no window and get today's month — the
  part the refresh rewrites every morning, and the only file available to a
  year the archive has yet to cover.

The explorer reads exactly what it read before, until the refresh publishes
a monthly part: today a Collection 1 search pays one extra HEAD for
`live-MM.parquet`, gets a 404, and `partUrls` filters it out exactly as it
filters an unpublished `live.parquet`, so the same two files are read. No
browser run was made: the two pure functions are tested in node and the rest
of the diff is the argument they feed.

`apps/explorer/search.js`: a part that answers **404 is now read as empty**.
It was not graceful before: `partMeta` threw `range read of … got HTTP 404`,
`Promise.all` rejected, and one missing file threw out the rows of every
other part in the search. The page HEAD-probes each part before reading it,
so this was unreachable in practice, but the two answers can disagree — a
fold can empty and replace a part between the probe and the read, and a
monthly part a window asks for may never have existed. Now `partMeta`
resolves an absent part with no row group, `searchPart` returns no row and
counts it, the printed plan says `N parts answered 404 and were read as
empty`, and `keyedRows` returns nothing for it. 403 counts as absent too,
which is what an object store answers for a key it will not discuss.

## Ruling 6 — the fold

`tools/rails/fold_live.sbatch` takes the candidate names from
`live_part_names()` and, per year, probes every one, downloads each part that
holds rows, folds all of them into `items.parquet` in the single existing
`s2_build` call (it already reads the whole input directory and dedupes by
`id`), writes a zero-row replacement for each part it folded, and uploads the
year file first and those replacements after it — the rule it always had,
now over more files. The `YEARS`-unset enumeration folds a year when its live
parts hold rows **between them**. Its dry run now prints one put for the year
file and thirteen for the live names, which the rails test pins in order.

## Ruling 7 — stats enumeration

`publish-stats.yml` asked one live name. It now resolves both lists in one
`python3 -c` (`archive_part_names` and `live_part_names` with the
collection's config) and probes every live name for the years `LIVE_YEARS`
selects. The first collection is unchanged (one `live.parquet`, current year
only); a Collection 1 rebuild pays thirteen HEADs a year over twelve years,
in a workflow a person dispatches by hand. The refresh's splice is described
under ruling 2.

New tests: `--months` and `live_part_names` (ruling 1, earlier commit), the
monthly probing in `make_items` (ruling 4, earlier commit), the app's
window-to-months mapping run in node, the refusal of a hand-typed part name
in any workflow, an emptied part's asset stating no time range, and the
fold's per-part upload order.

**The dry run.** `refresh-c1`'s plan, build, splice and upload steps were
lifted out of the YAML by name and run against a local fake bucket (two
years; a pre-monthly tail spanning July, August and September; a published
`live-05.parquet` the slice never touches; a published `live-09.parquet` it
does), with `s2_stats.py`, `upload_data.py` and the generators stubbed. The
run built `year=2019/live-03.parquet`, `year=2026/live-07/08/09.parquet` and
a zero-row `year=2026/live.parquet`; `live-09` came out at 60 rows, the union
of its published 50 and the slice's 10 with the ids deduped; the splice
named the two year files, the four built parts and the untouched
`live-05.parquet`, and no `live.parquet`; the upload printed the four monthly
parts through `--only` before the pass that uploads the emptied file. The
same body run a second time, with those parts copied into the fake bucket,
read zero rows in `live.parquet`, built month 9 alone, and spliced
`live-05/07/08` from the bucket — the idempotence claim above, executed.

The plan step was then run against the **real** bucket with a stand-in slice
(100 rows of the published 2026 tail, 20 rows of published 2019 items, both
read over HTTP). It reported `year=2026/live.parquet: 51,505 row(s)`, month 9
to fold, `migrate: true`, months to build `9`, and for 2019 `migrate: false`
with the months of the stand-in slice. The run wrote nothing to the bucket.

The laptop could not run two of the steps. One is the build against the real 4.7 GB
`year=2026/items.parquet` (the `--exclude-ids-from` read is minutes and the
fake bucket exercises the same code), and `mapfile`, which bash 3.2 does not
have — the dry run rewrote each `mapfile -t NAME < SRC` as the read loop it
is and ran every other line verbatim. The runners have bash 5, and the
`mapfile` lines the C1 job uses are the ones the first collection's job has
used since the year-loop change.

## What to watch on the first run under this scheme

1. The step log should say `year=2026/live.parquet: 51,505 row(s)` (or
   whatever the tail contains that morning) and `month(s) 9 to fold`.
2. The upload should show `--only sentinel-2-c1-l2a/year=2026/live-09.parquet`
   *before* the pass that uploads `live.parquet`.
3. Afterwards, `year=2026/live.parquet` should be a few KB and
   `year=2026/live-09.parquet` should hold the rows. The year item
   (`year=2026/2026.json`) should carry a `live-09` asset and a `live` asset
   with `table:row_count: 0`.
4. The day after, the log should say `year=2026/live.parquet: 0 row(s)` and
   build month 9 alone.

If run 1 fails between the two upload passes, do nothing: the next run
repeats the fold and the emptying. Do not delete the old file by hand.

// scene-count sliders then filter the cached rows. They redraw the result
// cards. No filter change reads the network again. The map paints on its
// own. It never queries the clicked tile-year. It paints from the stats'
// month slices for the current window. The choropleth and the scene list
// read the same window from two different sources.
// The same page shows Earth Search's Collection 1 (sentinel-2-c1-l2a, with

// that differs — directories, the tile column, which parts a year has, the
// two extra mask bands — and the sidebar's select reloads the page with
// the parameter set.
// There is no API, no server and no database behind this page: every
// parquet read — the scene search over the item parts, the stats timeline,
// the month slices and the per-tile history — goes through hyparquet
// (search.js), a small pure-JS reader, as HTTP range or whole-file fetches
// straight at the object store, and the COG reads work the same way. The
// map is MapLibre for the camera; the tiles are drawn by deck.gl
// interleaved into the same canvas (Task 20), because MapLibre's per-feature
